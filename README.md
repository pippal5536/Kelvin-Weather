## Introduction
This project is a simple weather converter that transforms temperature readings from Kelvin to Celsius and then to Fahrenheit. The project was developed as part of Codecademy's Learn JavaScript course.

## Project Problem
The problem addressed in this project is that all temperature forecasts from the mad scientist Kelvin are in Kelvin. Most people find it easier to understand temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit. The goal is to convert Kelvin temperatures to both Celsius and Fahrenheit for better accessibility and understanding.

## Solution Overview
The solution involves a JavaScript program that:
1. Declares a constant variable for the Kelvin temperature.
2. Converts the Kelvin temperature to Celsius.
3. Converts the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.
4. Rounds down the Fahrenheit temperature to the nearest integer using `Math.floor()`.
5. Outputs the Fahrenheit temperature to the console.


## Challenges Faced
One of the challenges faced was understanding how to properly use JavaScript's `Math.floor()` function to round down the Fahrenheit temperature. Additionally, ensuring the correct order of operations in the conversion formulas was essential to avoid logical errors.

## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I learned:
- The basics of temperature conversion between Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit.
- How to declare and manipulate variables in JavaScript.
- The use of `Math.floor()` for rounding numbers.
- Fundamental programming concepts such as constants and variables.

## Project Sources and Inspiration
This project was inspired and learned from Codecademy's Learn JavaScript course. The course provides a step-by-step guide to understanding JavaScript fundamentals and practical exercises to apply the concepts.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript: The programming language used to write the conversion logic.
- Codecademy: The platform where the project was developed and learned.

## Installation and Usage
To run this project:
1. Ensure you have a JavaScript runtime environment (like Node.js) or a web browser console.
2. Copy the provided JavaScript code into your runtime environment or a `.js` file.
3. Run the code to see the conversion output.

Example with Node.js:
```bash
node kelvinWeatherConverter.js
```
